## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Compile SASS
Sass is configured with gulp, consider it appropriate for the reason that angular cli places the css left and in ocaciones by seconds the page is left without styles and apart all the images placed by background make them base64.

So I decided to configure sass with gulp

In new console
`gulp`

Or if you want to compile at the same time ng serves and gulp can do so

`npm start` -- compile `ng serve & gulp`
